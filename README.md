# Linux Device Drivers examples 

ldd3: Linux Device Drivers 3 examples updated to work with recent kernels
This is my attempt to run the examples on Kernel 5.0.5. Feel free to use it according to the GPL license.


## About

Linux Device Drivers 3 (http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/) book is now a few years
old and most of the example drivers do not compile in recent kernels.

This project aims to keep LDD3 example drivers up-to-date with recent kernels.

The original code can be found at: http://examples.oreilly.com/9780596005900/

This is a fork of kernel 4.19.8 here https://github.com/martinezjavier/ldd3 

## Compiling


The example drivers should compile against latest Linus Torvalds kernel tree:
* git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git

I however used the stable build 5.0.5. 

## Patches used 

Will be updated if any used.
